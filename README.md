- 👋 Hi, I’m Riah @rcoulter13 and I am a second-year graduate student in University of Arizona's HLT program!
- 👀 I’m interested in Automatic Speech Recognition, POS taggers, tokenizers, machine translation, ML, etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about medical chatbots, ASR in very noisy environments and signal processing.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any interesting ASR tasks, translation tasks, or sentiment tasks.
